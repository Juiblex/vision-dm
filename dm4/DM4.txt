This assignment is about computing the essential matrix F associated
with n correspondences from the "house" data shown in class.

You can use the function readdata.m to read the data points by doing:
[points1,points2, edges]=readdata;

The columns of points1 and points2 with the same index should now
contain the image coordinates (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) of matching points
in the two images.

The variable edges will contain the house edges that may be useful for
display. For example, to display the points of points1 together with
the corresponding edges, do:
plot2dedges(points1,edges);

Now what you have to do:

1) Compute the fundamental matrix F directly from these points using
homogeneous linear least-squares; report the mean distance between the
points and the corresponding epipolar lines.

2) Write a function, that given F, draws the epipolar lines associated
with the points from points2, and overlays them on the points from
points1, drawn using plot2dedges.  Do the same switching the roles of
points1 and points2. Include the plots in  your report.

3) Do the same thing using the Harltley normalization (computation of
F and of the mean distance, plus plots).
